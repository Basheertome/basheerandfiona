			<h1>Fiona</h1>
			<h3>Fiona was born in San Jose, and comes from a big family. With three brothers and a little sister, the Herse Woo home was always loud & crowded, and a perfect place to grow up. Each summer, Fiona would spend her time at her grandfather's farm and at the beaches in Santa Cruz exploring the tidepools. After high school she pursued a degree in Marine Biology at Santa Cruz, but eventually graduated with a degree in Animation from San Jose State University.</h3>

			<h1>Basheer</h1>
			<h3>Basheer is from a small suburb just outside of Atlanta, Georgia. Basheerâ€™s family lives all around the world, and along with his parents and his sister, Maya, he spent much of his childhood playing LEGOs. In school Basheer enjoyed swimming and playing in the marching band. He earned his design degree near home at Georgia tech, and his masters at MIT in Boston. After three summer internships at Google, Basheer finally moved out West to work full time in Silicon Valley.</h3>

	<h3>Fiona was working on a small team making animated films for Google, when she learned that her team would soon be dissolved. A team in the building next door, making a then-secret Virtual Reality experience, was in need of artists, and brought her onboard.</h3>
	<h3>Soon she made a few friends at Google, and often they would spend their free time together, at lunch and outside of work. When Fiona first met Basheer, she was having lunch at a cafe called Fishfood. The second that she saw him, she knew there was something special about him. Sometimes she would see him at group events, at the movies, at the beach, in the city, and she wondered if he would ask her out, but he never did.</h3>
	<h3>Until... the company holiday party, when Basheer mentioned a plant store that he was thinking of going to the next day. Well Fiona loved plants, so it only seemed natural to come along, and in the morning they met at Flora Grubb nursery in San Francisco. They spent the whole day together after that, playing ken-ken, ordering pizza, hanging out at a friend's house. After dropping Basheer at home, they walked to a nearby park, where they sat on the grass, talking until 2am.</h3>

	<h3>It was clear from the beginning that they were a perfect match. Together they took trips to Japan and Italy. They adopted a rescue dog named Ohka. And they cooked and baked and bought literally 100 plants.</h3>
	<h3>After three happy years together, Basheer proposed during a romantic weekend in Carmel. 
	Fiona said yes! And the rest is history...</h3>
