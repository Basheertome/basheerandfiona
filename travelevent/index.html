	<h2>Weather &amp; Attire</h2>
	<h3><span>Weather:</span> We'll be in the middle of the spring season, so there is a low chance of rain and low humidity. The average temperature in mid May is <spgan>70°F</span> (21°C), but the drier conditions mean the low at night on average dips down to <span>50°F</span> (10°C) and at midday can reach up to a high of <span>80°F</span> (27°C).</h3>
	<h3><span>Attire:</span> Please note, <span>the entire event will take place outdoors</span> on a farm. The attire is semi-formal and you'll want to be prepared for the slightly cooler weather after the sun sets. The roads are unpaved, so keep this in mind if you choose to wear heels.</h3>

	<h1>Travel info</h1>
	<h3>If you're arriving by plane, the nearest airport is <span>Sacramento (SMF)</span> with a drive of about 1 hour by car. It's a fairly large international airport so there will likely be a good selection of times & prices for flights to there. But, regardless of how you're arriving here, <span>renting a car is highly recommended</span>.</h3>
	<div class="iframe"><iframe width="100%" height="100%" src='https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/basheer/ck82llux00mgd1io2ai5o6abk.html?fresh=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiYmFzaGVlciIsImEiOiJjajhvdHpzeTEwODhnMzJxdWJlZmN4OXB3In0.Ovpv9LFSCiwWdrKrKyzqlg#7/38.075/-121.9'></iframe></div>
	<h3>The rest of the San Francisco Bay Area is about 2-3 hours south, with Napa / Sonoma wine country sitting about halfway between. If you're thinking about extending your trip to include some time to explore the area before or after the wedding, then flying through one of the other airports might make sense.</h3>
	<h2>Where to stay</h2>
	<a href="https://g.page/HotelWinters" target="_blank">
		<img src="/images/hotelwinters.jpg" alt="" />
	</a>
	<h3>Our top recommendation is <a href="https://g.page/HotelWinters" target="_blank"><span>Hotel Winters</span></a>, about 40mins drive from the farm. It's a very nice boutique hotel in downtown Winters which itself is a very cute little town. The rooms might get booked quickly.</h3>
	<h3>In the town of Woodland, which is also 40mins away from the farm and close to Sacramento Airport, there are several other great options including a <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/z2nbULypyeavJq39A" target="_blank"><span>Fairfield Inn by Marriott</span></a>, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/qJbdvSf69vbg9SEEA" target="_blank"><span>Hampton Inn</span></a>, and <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/4dRkacMDSKsZXyah6" target="_blank"><span>Comfort Suites</span></a>.</h3>
	<h3>The closest place to stay is <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/2dXPyfrMbsqkie7v7" target="_blank"><span>Cache Creek Casino Resort</span></a>, which is a 15min drive away from the farm. It's a beautiful casino with nice rooms, and bookings for May are now available.</h3>
	<h3>Whether you stay at the casino or not, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/qssXBTE82fxqZww6A" target="_blank">Séka Hills</a> has an olive mill and tasting room across the street; we love their olive oil and it's worth checking out!</h3>
	<img src="/images/farmcamping.jpg" alt="" />
	<h3>P.S. if you're up for it, the farm itself has free campsites available the night of the wedding until the following Sunday morning at 10:00am, with power, water, 4 bathrooms, and 3 showers. BYO tent.</h3>

	<h1>Things to do</h1>
	<h5>Wine Country</h5>
	<h3>Napa and Sonoma valley are centrally located about 1hr away from Sacramento, Oakland, & San Francisco. They're famous for good reason, with a large variety of absolutely <span>gorgeous wineries & landscapes</span>. Beyond wine tasting, there's lots of amazing food to be had, with some places even doing olive oil tastings as well. If you've never been &amp; have the time, it's definitely worth the trip.</h3>
	<h3>The best meal we've ever had was at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/694nqmov4MfNfqm2A" target="_blank">Meadowood</a> ($$$$), we've had great burgers at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/TMgAjb7f5UcRJ3sU8" target="_blank">Gott's Roadside</a> ($$), and we've had amazing wine &amp; food at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Uc7sBvvHqTe4CYUKA" target="_blank">Scribe Winery</a> ($$$).</h3>
	<h5>Marin</h5>
	<h3>Across the Golden Gate Bridge just north of San Francisco are a whole series of gorgeous hikes, walks, &amp; views in Marin. The sight you can see at sunset from <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/sqb77nB3JTzphcAq7" target="_blank"><span>Mount Tamalpais East Peak</span></a> is our favorite thing to show visitors to San Francisco and it's only a ½km hike from plenty of parking. Along the way, check out <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/D4UyTQSxtgzZ4Bnd7" target="_blank"><span>Muir Woods</span></a> for an easy walk through the historic redwoods (warning: parking can be tough).</h3>
	<h3>Closer towards San Francisco, the town of <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/zZFvkh6EJ1Z4o9o26" target="_blank">Sausalito</a> is a wonderful place along the water to eat &amp; shop (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/z1PuZh18Muxu9nuN7" target="_blank">Heath Ceramics</a> sells great pottery &amp; has an amazing tour), and just off the last exit before the bridge is <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/3HQ89R29Bcx51Mg49" target="_blank">Hawk Hill</a> where you can get that postcard view of the Golden Gate.</h3>
	<h5>San Francisco</h5>
	<h3>In the Mission District, within just a few blocks you can visit <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/um6GV4oPFFCNxLZN7" target="_blank"><span>Tartine Manufactury</span></a> for SF’s most famous bread &amp; pastries, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/sHThfuys3jHo9Uqd6" target="_blank">Heath Ceramics</a> for beautiful mugs &amp; plates, and <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/oFhR2uahbfXHZfnf6" target="_blank">Aesthetic Union</a> for nice art supplies. Later in the evening, you can check out <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/N6YP1sydKwSyAvrj8" target="_blank">La Taqueria</a> for Basheer’s favorite tacos in the world, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Xm7bJoJ7MogYEjFz7" target="_blank">Flour & Water</a> for great pizza &amp; pasta, or <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/JF3aa9TU6jgb8R139" target="_blank">Trick Dog</a> for delicious drinks &amp; a rotating theme.</h3>
	<h3>In Hayes Valley, while you take a look at all the little boutiques in the area, you should get your caffeine fix at either <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/4UrDw38JBv5Fa6EX8" target="_blank"><span>Blue Bottle Coffee</span></a> for a tasty espresso drink or <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/LLaNjkpz8R774w3bA" target="_blank">Boba Guys</a> for ridiculously good bubble tea. For something sweet, head to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/iJxYgVXwC8SJxkuB7" target="_blank">Bi-Rite Creamery</a> for our favorite ice cream. If you get hungry, check out <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/KN7gzQswVCGtNRjn9" target="_blank">The Mill</a> for the world's fanciest toast or <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/quEUffmo3oQx7SgK9" target="_blank">Petit Crenn</a> for a really nice dinner.</h3>
	<h3>In downtown along the Embarcadero, the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/9mrjx6zNHgaEnTsC9" target="_blank">Ferry Building</a> is a market filled with nice shops &amp; restaurants. Not too far is the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/stbtsE4AQRr7qgym9" target="_blank">Exploratorium</a>, a phenomenal science museum with tons of things to touch &amp; play with. For dinner, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/XVqJrFRN9cZ3eEYg9" target="_blank"><span>Zuni Cafe</span></a> is a city favorite that keeps putting out fabulous food and if you have time, order the chicken.</h3>
	<h3>If you find yourself near the ocean, check out <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/s8ZE5szcntxJRKY29" target="_blank"><span>Outerlands</span></a>; it's our favorite restaurant for any meal. If there's a wait, next door is a cute <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/4HUGBB9vdYa2URkA7" target="_blank">bookstore</a>, an <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/kQzCrLhLMVBWFV6eA" target="_blank">art supply store</a>, nice <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/BUeyeaybzfYgVh9E9" target="_blank">home goods store</a>, and good <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/5V3R2pdWUze5r8tw5" target="_blank">coffee shop</a>. Don't forget to visit <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Dbg2pTJ8YGG53iJc9" target="_blank"><span>Golden Gate Park</span></a> too!</h3>
	<h3>On the outerskirts of the city, head to the eastern side for <a href="https://g.page/Flora-Grubb-Gardens" target="_blank"><span>Flora Grubb</span></a>, a beautiful plant store & coffee shop where we’ve had many dates, including our first! Lastly, just south of SF in Daly City you can find <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/tEw6mJEtr5FPsFH49" target="_blank">Koi Palace</a>, our favorite place for eating Dim Sum.</h3>
